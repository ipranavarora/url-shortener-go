## Technologies Used

- Go programming language
- `gorilla/mux` for HTTP routing
- `crypto/md5` for generating hash-based short URLs
- `encoding/json` for JSON encoding and decoding
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go installed on your local machine. You can download it from [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/).
- Git for version control. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/url-shortener.git
   cd url-shortener
   ```
2.Install dependencies (`gorilla/mux`):
  ```bash
  go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux
```

## Usage

### Starting the Server

To start the server, run the following command:

```bash
go run main.go
```

The server will start on port 8080 by default. You can change the port by modifying the main.go file.


### Shortening URLs
Send a POST request to /shorten with a JSON body containing the original URL:
```bash
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"url":"http://example.com"}' http://localhost:8080/shorten
```
### Redirecting Short URLs

Access `/redirect/<short-url>` in your browser or use `curl`:

```bash
curl -I http://localhost:8080/redirect/<short-url>
```
Replace <short-url> with the short URL generated by the /shorten endpoint.
